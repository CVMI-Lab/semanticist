# "Principal Components" Enable A New Language of Images

## Installation

First makesure pytorch is installed (we used 2.5.1).

Then install the rest of the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Note

It's possible that this code may not accurately replicate the results outlined in the paper due to potential human errors during the preparation and cleaning of the code for release. If you encounter any difficulties in reproducing our findings, please don't hesitate to inform us. Additionally, we'll make an effort to carry out sanity-check experiments in the near future.

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely appreciate the dedicated support we received from the participants of the human study. We are also grateful to Anlin Zheng and Haochen Wang for helpful suggestions on the design of technical details.
